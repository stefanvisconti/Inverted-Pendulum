# Inverted-Pendulum

In the realm of control systems engineering, the challenge of stabilising inverted pendulum systems epitomises the balance between theoretical principles and engineering innovation. This technical report provides a comprehensive exploration of the design and construction of an inverted pendulum system, delving into the underlying theory rooted in nonlinear dynamics and control theory. The report examines two fundamental approaches to inverted pendulum control: the utilisation of reaction wheels and designs akin to the self-balancing mechanism of a Segway.

A screenshot of the implemented design is shown below.
